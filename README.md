# The Wild Oasis

Welcome to **The Wild Oasis Hotel Management Application** documentation! The Wild Oasis is a user-friendly platform designed to efficiently manage hotel operations, including sales statistics, cabin management, user profiles, bookings, and customizable settings. It offers built-in authentication, secure database storage, and dark mode support‚Äîalong with much more!

This project showcases advanced **JavaScript** and **Database Query** skills, integrated into a functional web application. It also aims to deepen my understanding of **React.js** through real-world implementation.

I strongly believe in the philosophy of **"Learning by Doing"**, which inspired the development of this project.
